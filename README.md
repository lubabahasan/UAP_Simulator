UAP Simulator is a test-based multi-choice adventure game my project team and I made for our OOP course.
The story of this game is based on the day-to-day life at UAP as a student.

Currently the game has a total of 15 stages, and is focused on only one semester.
In the future, I might work on the no. of stages, the UI, storyline, choices, and the many possible endings.
