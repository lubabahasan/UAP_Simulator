UAP Simulator is a test-based multi-choice adventure game my project team and I made for our OOP Lab course.
The story of this game is based on the day-to-day life of a student of the CSE department of UAP.

Currently, the game has 15 stages in total and is focused on only one semester.
In the future, I might work on the no. of stages, the UI, the storyline, choices, and the many possible endings.
